<center>A little about me...</center>

## Background
Asian-Canadian. Would like a green card. Afraid of romance. Trying to get in the habit of writing things that get published.

## This Blog
Was created using Github and Jekyll. I don't know any html or whatever the crap it's called. This is why every change is taking me about an hour. Took me three days to figure out how to make this stupid background less opaque. **Three Days.** I bought a custom domain using namecheap, got this little beauty for $12 a year. Suck it.
