I've wanted to be a writer since middle school, maybe elementary school. Whenever it was that I fell in love with reading. Writing was a lot of things to me, an outlet, an escape, and a way to transform intangible feelings from a complicated mess of gibberish into something concrete. It validated me.

What's your dream job? I don't know, a writer? Whatever the fuck that is. A journalist, maybe? Book editor? What's a realistic way for me to finagle a career out of such a vague hobby? Everyone likes reading. In my opinion, writing - prolific writing - necessitates talent and hard work. I have an abundance of neither. But where would talent get me, even? I bear no overreaching dreams of having any work of mine memorialized through the throes of time. Just to be able to create a fleeting feeling of camaraderie with a stranger, that'd be nice. It's lovely (funny, the word 'lovely' has become a staple in my vocabulary, inherited from an ex boyfriend) to think that the way I frame an experience can be appreciated and sympathized with by a total stranger, whose life I know nothing of. Lovely indeed

So I shall do my best to keep typing away.
