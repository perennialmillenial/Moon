It's been nearly three weeks since I landed in Reykjavik and began what can absolutely be crowned as the greatest adventure of my life thus far. Now, I will try to detail it in immaculate detail, immortalize this experience. Knowing me, there'll be a day when I'll need to relive these moments.

6.30am - I've landed in Kleflavik Airport. Got a coffee from Joe & The Juice on the way out of the airport, excited to have a first taste of this new country. Found out six days later that this was, in fact, a Danish chain. Ah well.

Followed a few signs to the bus terminal. Get a ticket for the fly bus to downtown Reykjavik. Realize on the bus that I've forgotten to buy a SIM card from the duty-free store. Dang it.

Before long I'm the last passenger on the minibus. The driver looks pretty fed up with his day and elects to drop me off at an unfamiliar intersection that obviously did not house 'Reykjavik Downtown Hostel'. I ask him how to get there, he points in a direction that was vaguely to the left, and drives off. Off to a great start, but that's okay. I'm feeling awake, and the adrenaline from being in a new destination has long since kicked in.

Luckily, I remembered to download an offline google map of the entire western half of Iceland. As such, I find my home for the next six nights with little trouble. After checking in and dropping off my luggage, I immediately embark on my adventure.

My plan for the day was to walk around the city, establish some familiarity with the area, and check out all the museums. Tip #1 - check the museum operating hours. Apparently 'winter schedules' are a thing here, and none of the museums I go to are open on a Monday.

Unfortunate, but only slightly disappointing. I happen upon a grocery story on my way back to the hostel and load up on supplies (sufficient research before this trip taught me that eating out was flipping expensive in Iceland). Supples: bananas, protein bread (this magnificently fluffy mix of bread and seeds), peanut butter, strawberry jelly, a bag of peanuts, and trail mix. This, in addition to the 20 sticks of jerky and 15 Kind bars I packed in my suitcase.

Feeling quite proud of myself, I stroll back home, making sure to take note of all the various store fronts I pass so as to familiarize myself with streets.

Once home, I unload my supplies in my little locker and notice that one of the girls in the bunk to my right is awake. We exchange pleasantries and some small talk. She's American (a tourist, like me) and is here for about the same amount of time as me. She's from Minnesota, a mother with two young kids. I never would've guessed, she looked so young. Sweet, high voice, long straw colored hair parted in the middle. Her words always had a touch of anxiety, like she was hurrying to finish her sentences. Her name was Sarah, and she proves to be a good friend/easy talking companion the rest of the trip. Although, unfortunately, there is a bizarre connection between us - where things seem to work out fantastically well for me but much less so for her. Eh, it's hard to explain.

Around 8pm or so, I am downstairs, waiting to be picked up for my first tour. It's in a super jeep, and we are going to hunt the aurora borealis. Pretty damn cool for my first night here. When I get in the jeep, there are already two girls there. A pair of sisters from Florida (who were born in Columbia) and they are immediately friendly and funny. This is their second trip together, the first being a relaxing two weeks spent on 'surfing and yoga' in Costa Rica. We also pick up a couple of other people, and are soon on our way to our destination with another jeep following us.

We go off road and arrive at a dilapidated old farmhouse, with a small church off to the side (probably the size of a studio apartment in Chicago). This will be the place we wait to see the lights. Anita, our guide, sets up the camera and points out the first hint of the lights to us - a faint, barely visible green mist arching over the horizon. This green mist turns into a slightly more defined band on camera. It's something, but different from my expectations.

The lights get brighter as the night progresses, but nothing quite like what you see on the postcards. This does not disappoint for long, when you take a moment and let yourself appreciate the magic that is the northern lights for what it is. The lights move visibly, the band stretching and spearing off in different directions overhead. It's all very impressive.

We stay for around three hours, and just as I begin to contemplate a future without toes, Anita whips out two thermoses full of Icelandic hot chocolate she's made. On a frosty (freaking freezing) night, with the northern lights overhead, this is the best hot chocolate I've ever had. Sweet and heavy, like gentle flames licking my veins with their warmth. She whips out a box of donuts. I want to kiss her.

We are there for an hour more before leaving. It is close to 2am when I get home. My heart is full, and already so enamored.
