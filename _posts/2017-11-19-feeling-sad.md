I'm scared, because I drank a little yesterday and tried to drown you in an aspect of my life you maybe weren't ready to take on yet. I wanted to share some of the parts of myself that were healing/hurting because I thought you had been hurt and healed in the same way. There's justification in the fear I am experiencing now, although I know I won't be devastated even if you don't... er... text me...

Fine, it does sound just as stupid on 'paper' as I suspected. Maybe it's for the best, I've been farting all day from these stupid low-calorie halo-top ice cream pints I've been shoving down my throat.
