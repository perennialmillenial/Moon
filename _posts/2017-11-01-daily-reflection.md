 I've been back home for three days now and the complacency/boredom/whatever the fuck you want to call it has already set in and quite frankly I am starting to feel absolutely pathetic. No... that's a lie. Not pathetic. Strange.

 First there's motivation. Definitely. I've began courting the idea of moving to Iceland, and have gotten to second base with the immigration website today. It doesn't look unfeasible, but definitely not easy either. I've been quite fortunate all my life though, and am just spoiled enough to think that this might happen for me if I really tried.

 Is this denial, what I'm feeling right now? A refreshed spirit? I've been working inordinately long hours these past few days. Maybe I'm just trying to distract from this bittersweet heartbreak resulting from my brief romantic tryst. Who do I miss? What do I miss? I truly felt like I was my best self then. I suppose it was just a successful vacation, but I can't seem to let go. It's only been five days since I've been back, so I suppose it makes sense. Depressed, definitely. Sadness, the kind that begs attention and pity. If only I could let my feelings spill forth onto paper in an eloquent way. Maybe it's okay for me to try.

 ~~I miss Iceland so much.~~
